# Chapter 5: Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), or ConvNets, are a special class of feedforward networks; they are primarily used for computer vision tasks, but have also been adapted to other domains with unstructured data, such as natural language processing. As they are feedforward networks, they are very similar to the simple networks that we just learned about; information passes through them in one direction, and they are made up of layers, weights, and biases.

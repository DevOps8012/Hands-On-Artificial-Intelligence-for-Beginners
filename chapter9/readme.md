# Chapter 9: Deep Learning for Intelligent Agents

Intelligent Assistants are one of the most visible forms of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that we see in our daily lives. Siri, Alexa, and other systems have come to be commonplace in day-to-day life in the 21st century. This chapter will commence our section of chapters that dive deeply into the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for creating AI systems. In this chapter, we will cover one new topic, word embeddings, and then proceed to focus on the application of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and generative networks to natural language processing tasks. While an entire book could have been written about deep learning for natural language processing, as is already the case, we'll touch upon the core concepts that you'll need to get started in building natural language AI platforms.
